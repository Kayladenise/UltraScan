# What is UltraScan ? üí° 
We developed a desktop application namely UltraScan which harnesses the power of deep learning through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fetal head measurements. By analyzing ultrasound images, UltraScan offers a cutting-edge, reliable solution for prenatal assessment, significantly improving the precision of biometric measurements. This innovative approach not only streamlines the process for healthcare providers but also ensures that expectant parents receive timely and accurate information about fetal development. Ultimately, UltraScan represents a transformative leap in prenatal imaging technology.

# Tools and Framework üíª

**TensorFlow**ü§ñ
The application is powered by TensorFlow as its backend framework, hosting a sophisticated deep learning model that enables real-time analysis of ultrasound images and precise fetal head measurements. This framework efficiently processes data by interfacing directly with ultrasound equipment, facilitating seamless image acquisition and preprocessing. TensorFlow‚Äôs advanced capabilities enhance the accuracy of biometric assessments, making it a critical component for informed prenatal care.

**Tkinter**‚ö°
As the frontend framework, Tkinter offers a user-friendly and versatile interface that allows seamless interaction with the application's functionalities. Its event-driven programming model ensures responsive handling of user inputs, contributing to a smooth user experience. With the ability to create visually appealing and intuitive graphical user interfaces, Tkinter is an ideal choice for developing desktop applications that require an efficient and powerful GUI, making complex functionalities accessible to users with varying technical backgrounds.
